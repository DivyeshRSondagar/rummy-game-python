------------------ Rules -------------------- 
- Rummy is a card game based on making sets. 
- From a stash of 13 cards, 4 sets must be created (3 sets of 3, 1 set of 4). 
- The set of 4 must always be at the end
- A valid set can either be a run or a book. 
- One set must be a run WITHOUT using a joker.
- A run is a sequence of numbers in a row, all with the same suit.  
 	For example: 4 of Hearts, 5 of Hearts, and 6 of Hearts 
- A book of cards must have the same rank but may have different suits. 
 	For example: 3 of Diamonds, 3 of Spades, 3 of Clubs 
- Jokers are randomly picked from the deck at the start of the game. 
- Joker is denoted by '-J' and can be used to complete sets. 
- During each turn, the player may take a card from the pile or from the deck. Immediately after, the player must drop any one card into the pile so as not go over the 13 card limit. 
- When a player has created all the sets, select Close Game option and drop the excess card into the pile. 
- Card with Rank 10 is represented as Rank T
